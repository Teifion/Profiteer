**Summary**
A framework for running a web-app from. It includes user handling and a database synchroniser.

**History**
The profiteer framework came about from my (Rob3)[https://github.com/Teifion/Rob3] project. I wanted to use something similar for both another game (called profiteer) and later a works project. Profiteer was scrapped but another idea I've had will use it so I figured I'd make it an open source project.

It is placed here primarily for others to see what I've done (and hopefully benefit from it). I've never found other frameworks easy to use so I rolled my own. It's designed to be dead simple to install (though currently lacks a script to automatically generate the empty files.
